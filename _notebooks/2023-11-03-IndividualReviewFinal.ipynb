    "In the initial phase, I achieved significant progress on the frontend, collaborating with a partner to create simple games and deepen my understanding of JavaScript. I began by coding quizzes and basic games, later exploring existing game code for inspiration. This exploration led to the development of a guessing game involving elements from a soccer penalty kick. Further learning from tutorials contributed to my involvement in a passion project focused on frontend and backend development. The project aimed to create a platform allowing users to rent vehicles, with my main contributions focusing on frontend structuring and integrating backend processes for pulling data storage. This dual involvement in frontend and backend work provided a comprehensive learning experience, particularly in operations regarding linking the frontend to  the database.\n",

    "Our final project is a car rental website that allows users to select from our arsenal of performance and luxury cars for rental. Our info button extracts details from a backend API and outputs results in the frontend webpage about the specs of the vehicle that the customer is interested in. I was working with the frontend side of the project, but I also helped out with configuring and debugging the backend.\n",

    "At the beginning of the trimester, my team and I worked on a binary project. Within the team, we divided tasks, and my focus was primarily on a binary conversion for colors, and the image converter. I researched the color conversion and  binary algorithms, and resulted creatin the main structure for the rest of my team to work on. Other team members finished the game and binary clock aspects of our project. Looking forward to our current project, which involves an online webcreator for games, my emphasis will shift towards backend developmen while still contributing majorly to the front end.\n"

The next IF condition will also be true because n is at least 1. The next IF condition will be false because n is less than 30. The next IF condition will be false because n is less than 10.
