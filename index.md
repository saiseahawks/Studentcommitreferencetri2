This picture represents me in many different ways. At the center is the Seattle Seahawks which is my favorite team. SD represents San Diego, the city I have been born and raised in. FF represents freinds and family because they are very important to me. I love soccer, football, and water sports. I swim for Del Norte Varsity. Cars are my hobbie and I enjoy learning about the cool features that make them work. I have lots of interests and passions that I hope to include in my projects in CSP this year!!
## Overview of Hacks, Study and Tangibles
Blogging in GitHub pages is a way to learn and code at the same time. 

- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder.
