This picture represents me in many different ways. At the center is the Seattle Seahawks which is my favorite team. SD represents San Diego, the city I have been born and raised in. FF represents freinds and family because they are very important to me. I love soccer, football, and water sports. I swim for Del Norte Varsity. Cars are my hobbie and I enjoy learning about the cool features that make them work. I have lots of interests and passions that I hope to include in my projects in CSP this year!!
